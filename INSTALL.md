Netgen Admin UI install instructions
------------------------------------

Netgen Admin UI requires a fully functional eZ Publish Community 2014.12 (Netgen Variant),
eZ Publish 5 or eZ Platform with Legacy Bridge so make sure you have it installed and fully
configured before installing Netgen Admin UI.

## Activate the Admin UI bundle along with other required bundles

Adding the bundle to the kernel before installing it via Composer makes sure that the legacy extension is symlinked to eZ Publish Legacy extension folder as well as that bundle assets will be installed immediately after requiring the package.

Add the following in your `app/AppKernel.php` file:

```php
public function registerBundles()
{
    ...

    $bundles[] = new Lolautruche\EzCoreExtraBundle\EzCoreExtraBundle();
    $bundles[] = new Netgen\Bundle\AdminUIBundle\NetgenAdminUIBundle();

    return $bundles;
}
```

## Use Composer to install the package 

```
composer require netgen/admin-ui-bundle:^2.0
```

## Import the `routing.yml` from the bundle into your main `routing.yml` file

Since this file overrides some built in routes, make sure you put it at the end of your `routing.yml`:

```
_netgen_admin_ui:
    resource: "@NetgenAdminUIBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml"
```

## Activate the legacy `ngadminui` extension along with other required extensions

Add the following in your central `site.ini.append.php` file (usually `ezpublish_legacy/settings/override/site.ini.append.php`):

```
[ExtensionSettings]
ActiveExtensions[]=ngadminui
ActiveExtensions[]=ngsymfonytools
ActiveExtensions[]=ezdemo
ActiveExtensions[]=ezjscore
ActiveExtensions[]=ezoe
```

## Run the installation wizard

Run the following command from your installation root to install Netgen Admin UI configuration and follow on-screen instructions:

```
$ php app/console ngadminui:install
```

This will install all required configuration in two places:

* `app/config/ngadminui.yml`
* `ezpublish_legacy/settings/siteaccess/NEW_SITEACCESS_NAME`
 
where `NEW_SITEACCESS_NAME` will be the name of the new siteaccess you selected during the installation wizard.

## Activate the generated configuration

The generated configuration is not activated automatically, so you need to activate it by yourself:

Import `app/config/ngadminui.yml` in your `app/config/ezplatform.yml`:

```
imports:
    - { resource: ngadminui.yml }
```

Activate the generated legacy siteaccess in your central `site.ini.append.php` file (usually `ezpublish_legacy/settings/override/site.ini.append.php`):

```
[SiteAccessSettings]
AvailableSiteAccessList[]=NEW_SITEACCESS_NAME
```

## That's it

Clear the caches and make sure that **only your editors/administrators** have `user/login` policy to the new Admin UI siteaccess.

Admin UI will be accessible at `/NEW_SITEACCESS_NAME` URL of your installation.
